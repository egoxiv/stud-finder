# Stud Finder Project

A SPA (single page app) website for an equestrian establishment offering breeding and sales of Registered Tennessee Walking Horses.

Created for CodeFellows 301 class, DEC 2015 by Laurie Brown, Whitney Harvey, and Erik Gomez.

## User Stories: Viewer

 - As a viewer, I want to be able to use the page on a mobile device and have it look nice.

 - As a viewer, I want to be able to click on an image in the gallery and see a video of the horse. Figure out how to implement on mobile.

 - As a viewer, when I click on the name of the horse I want to be taken directly to that section of the page to find out more information about the horse.

 - As a viewer, I want to be able to access the ancestry of the horse quickly and have it display in an intuitive manner and be able to collapse the information.

 - As a viewer, I want the site to remember what info I have collapsed and expanded and what "page/tab" I'm on.



## User Stories: Author

- As an author, I want to be able to update information regarding a horse and have the site update dynamically. (CRUD)



## User Stories: Developer

- As a developer, I want to use the mobile first and SMACSS philosophies to keep my code organized and easily maintainable.

- As a developer, I want all the ancestry data regarding all the horses to be in an external JSON formatted file so that the site can be populated dynamically. And the same data could be used for multiple purposes on the site.

- As a developer, I want to use a template for sections of the site that use repeating elements to reduce redundancy.

- As a developer, I want to have the site be a SPA (single page app) but have the user be able to us the browserâ€™s forward and back buttons.
